Enabling a data-based circular economy via global collaboration and local production

Our vision is to promote a circular, resilient, and digitally-based mode of production and consumption that enables the greatest possible sovereignty, empowerment and participation of citizens all over the world.

We want to support Fab Cities to produce everything they consume by 2054 based on collaboratively developed and globally shared data as commons on the web.
