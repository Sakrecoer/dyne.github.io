Ulterior States, an IamSatoshi production, is an argumentative
documentary project. The participatory development, production and
post ‘guerilla-film-making-methods’, bounced between (non-academic)
literature research, video interviews and studio sessions. This
investigative process allowed having real-life conversations with some
thought leaders within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In an attempt to portray
the community behind the message to adopt a network, being a one-man
team allowed for easier access to the subjects. The enthusiasm and
commitment that saturate through the lens in many parts of the film,
expose how the adopters of Bitcoin want to explore, to probe and, to
show the world, something important, otherwise overlooked.\

The film took three years and 125 videos to complete. Through this
journey, I got immersed in the decentralised crypto-currency culture
and met a bunch of wonderful futuristic-pirates, I would have never
met otherwise. It is becoming easier to admit that Ulterior States is
an expression of my perceptions, an extract of the years
2012-2015. The collaged story explores code as activism and discovers
a melting pot through the neutrality of a decentralised consensus. It
looks to the future from different humanist perspectives and argues
that crypto-currencies could lead towards; community governed
micro-state applications.

Ulterior States was completely self-funded and produced as a final
project for London South Bank University \[MA – Arts & Humanity –
Digital Film].
