# ZShaolin :: GNU/Linux Android terminal

 

## The Android ZSH powerup

![zshwiki-logo](https://www.dyne.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/zshwiki-logo.gif)ZShaolin unleashes the power of **GNU/Linux on your Android** phone or tablet by installing a small and powerful **shell environment**.

It is an Android terminal app coming with applications to **edit images, audio and video** using **batch scripts** one can write and upload. **It does not require rooting**, not even an Internet connection to work.

Why a console terminal on Android? considered the power of phone and tablets today, limiting yourself to rub a touchscreen is like spending time cuddling a tiger…

## Documentation

If you are new to the **console terminal** then you can start reading this [manual about the command line](http://en.flossmanuals.net/command-line/), which is also [available in Spanish](http://translate.flossmanuals.net/CommandLineIntro_es).

If you are wondering what is better in Zsh compared to other shells, then [find more about it on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) and on the [Zsh users wiki](http://zshwiki.org). ZShaolin comes with this fantastic shell pre-configured to speed up its usage with many aliases and macros here you can [download a reference card of shortcuts](http://grml.org/zsh/grml-zsh-refcard.pdf) (borrowed from the Grml distribution).

> If you have ninja-powers with computers, ZShaolin gives you the ninja tools on Android.

You will find more details about **image manipulation** possibilities in the [ImageMagick scripting documentation](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-tools.php).

For audio manipulation refer to the [SoX documentation](http://sox.sourceforge.net/Docs/Documentation).

For the video manipulation there is the [FFMpeg documentation](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html).

And never forget to ask your geek friends for help, scripting together can be a lot of fun!

Development of ZShaolin started recently. It can grow with your support, that’s why we are selling it for a coin on the Android Market. Meanwhile, **all the [sourcecode of ZShaolin](http://code.dyne.org/zshaolin) is free and opensource**, also the toolchain used to build it is made available for [download on our FTP](http://ftp.dyne.org/zshaolin), so if you really want this app without paying then you can grab it and build it yourself… we can go in detail on [Github/dyne/ZShaolin](http://github.com/dyne/zshaolin) when there is time.

This webpage is updated stating the income of app sales on the Android Market and how they are reinvested in ZShaolin and similar projects aimed to make Android a decent environment for geeks.

## Sales income

Recently our app surpassed the 650 sales, many factors helped: the Emacs org-mode community has discovered our Emacs works like a charm (as long one installs also the [free Emacs app by Zielmicha](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zielm.emacs) which provides the lisp files on the sdcard) plus [the XDA-DEV community has been very positive reviewing ZShaolin](http://www.xda-developers.com/android/transform-your-android-device-into-a-powerful-linux-machine-with-zshaolin/) and I’ve started releasing an “[XDA-light](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2558481)” version on their forums. Of course also the many positive reviews helped.

> On some small and portable devices ZShaolin is being very handy for me, I hope for you too! ;^) Android ARM devices are very portable and affordable and with this app I can use it just like I used computers in the past 20 years. ([Jaromil](http://j.dyne.org), dev)

As of the 1.0 release the income for sales is almost up to **2000$**. **Thanks everyone for chipping in**! The very first investment has been an MK 802 computer running Android, which costed approx 60$ and helped **a lot** to ease the development process without involving a developer’s personal phone :^) Later an Acer Iconia tablet for 150$ was bought and used to test and a bluetooth Apple keyboard which became my favorite setup when travelling. After a while I’ve upgraded to a Nexus7 (approx 300$) and gave the slower Iconia tablet to my parents (their first tablet!) plus I bought another Iconia for my sister’s birthday present.

More recently I’ve visited our [Museo dell’Informatica Funzionante](http://museum.freaknet.org) in Sicily and we hifived InI bro’ Crash left me a new Nexus5 with broken screen, he had sex on it or so. I made it repaired for 200$ or so giving the money to young skilled guys running a repair shop in Haarlem. Now with the Nexu5 I hope to fix [this](https://bugs.dyne.org/view.php?id=381) soon. Meanwhile to celebrate release 1.0 I have bought an Acer Chromebook 2 equipped with a Tegra K1 ARM chip and a 13″ screen reaching full HD resolution (for approx 400$) – and I’m now studying to port ZShaolin also to Chrome OS for ARM devices. The rest of the money all goes to local taxes, some beerz and to the Dyne.org foundation supporting this project with infrastructure and love <3

Again a big THANKS to all those who bought this set of knives so far!! :^D

This application re-distributes the works of many talented developers: it would have never been possible to have ZShaolin without them. While it is impossible to list all names here, you should consider ZShaolin as made by several hundreds of people in about 10 to 20 years time. At the bottom of this list the maintainer of ZShaolin, blacksmith of its toolchain and build scripts is [Jaromil](http://rastasoft.org).

Special thanks go to Jack Palevich for the terminal emulator, Spartacus Rex for the system installer and INPORTB for BotBrew (we borrowed a few binaries for this release).
